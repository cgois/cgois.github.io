abstract: High-dimensional quantum steering can be seen as a test for the dimensionality
  of entanglement, where the devices at one side are not characterized. As such, it
  is an important component in quantum informational protocols that make use of high-dimensional
  entanglement. Although it has been recently observed experimentally, the phenomenon
  of high-dimensional steering is lacking a general certification procedure. We provide
  necessary and sufficient conditions to certify the entanglement dimension in a steering
  scenario. These conditions are stated in terms of a hierarchy of semidefinite programs,
  which can also be used to quantify the phenomenon using the steering dimension robustness.
  To demonstrate the practical viability of our method, we characterize the dimensionality
  of entanglement in steering scenarios prepared with maximally entangled states measured
  in mutually unbiased bases. Our methods give significantly stronger bounds on the
  noise robustness necessary to experimentally certify high-dimensional entanglement.
