abstract: Quantum state tomography is the standard technique for reconstructing a
  quantum state from experimental data. In the regime of finite statistics, experimental
  data cannot give perfect information about the quantum state. A common way to express
  this limited knowledge is by providing confidence regions in the state space. Though
  other confidence regions were previously proposed, they are either too wasteful
  to be of practical interest, cannot easily be applied to general measurement schemes,
  or are too difficult to report. Here we construct confidence regions that solve
  these issues, as they have an asymptotically optimal sample cost and good performance
  for realistic parameters, are applicable to any measurement scheme, and can be described
  by an ellipsoid in the space of Hermitian operators. Our construction relies on
  a vector Bernstein inequality and bounds with high probability the Hilbertâ€“Schmidt
  norm error of sums of multinomial samples transformed by linear maps.
