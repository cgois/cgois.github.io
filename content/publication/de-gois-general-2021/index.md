abstract: Preparing and measuring physical systems are the operational building blocks
  of any physical experiment, and to describe them is the first purpose of any physical
  theory. Remarkably, even when only uncharacterized preparation and measurement devices
  are present, it is sometimes possible to distinguish between the behaviors of quantum
  and classical systems from only observational data. Certifying the physical origin
  of measurement statistics in the prepare and measure scenario is of primal importance
  for developing quantum networks, distributing quantum keys, and certifying randomness,
  to mention a few applications, but, surprisingly, no general methods to do so are
  known. We progress on this problem by crafting a general, sufficient condition to
  certify that a given set of preparations can only generate classical statistics,
  for any number of generalized measurements. As an application, we employ the method
  to demonstrate nonclassicality activation in the prepare and measure scenario, also
  considering its application in random access codes. Following that, we adapt our
  method to certify, again through a sufficient condition, whether a given set of
  measurements can never give rise to nonclassical behaviors, irrespective of what
  preparations they may act upon. This, in turn, allows us to find a large set of
  incompatible measurements that cannot be used to demonstrate nonclassicality, thus
  showing incompatibility is not sufficient for nonclassicality in the prepare and
  measure scenario.
