abstract: A central aspect of quantum information is that correlations between spacelike
  separated observers sharing entangled states cannot be reproduced by local hidden
  variable (LHV) models, a phenomenon known as Bell nonlocality. If one wishes to
  explain such correlations by classical means, a natural possibility is to allow
  communication between the parties. In particular, LHV models augmented with two
  bits of classical communication can explain the correlations of any two-qubit state.
  Would this still hold if communication is restricted to measurement outcomes? While
  in certain scenarios with a finite number of inputs the answer is yes, we prove
  that if a model must reproduce all projective measurements, then for any qubit-qudit
  state the answer is no. In fact, a qubit-qudit under projective measurements admits
  an LHV model with outcome communication if and only if it already admits an LHV
  model without communication. On the other hand, we also show that when restricted
  sets of measurements are considered (for instance, when the qubit measurements are
  in the upper hemisphere of the Bloch ball), outcome communication does offer an
  advantage. This exemplifies that trivial properties in standard LHV scenarios, such
  as deterministic measurements and outcome-relabelling, play a crucial role in the
  outcome communication scenario.
