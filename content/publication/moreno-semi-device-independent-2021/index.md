abstract: Superdense coding is a paradigmatic protocol in quantum information science,
  employing a quantum communication channel to send classical information more efficiently.
  As we show here, it can be understood as a particular case of a prepare and measure
  experiment, a scenario that has attracted growing attention for its fundamental
  and practical applications. Formulating superdense coding as a prepare and measure
  scenario allows us to provide a semi-device-independent witness of entanglement
  that significantly improves over previous tests. Furthermore, we also show how to
  adapt our results into self-testing of maximally entangled states and also provide
  a semidefinite program formulation allowing one to efficiently optimize, for any
  shared quantum state, the probability of success in the superdense coding protocol.
