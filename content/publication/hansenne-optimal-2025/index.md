abstract: Characterizing large-scale quantum systems is central to fundamental physics
  and essential for applications of quantum technologies. While a full characterization
  requires exponentially increasing resources, focusing on application-relevant information
  can often lead to significantly simplified analysis. Overlapping tomography is such
  a scheme, allowing one to obtain all the information contained in specific subsystems
  of multiparticle quantum systems in an efficient manner, but the ultimate limits
  of this approach remain elusive. We present protocols for overlapping tomography
  that are optimal with respect to the number of measurement settings. First, by providing
  algorithmic approaches based on graph theory we find the minimal number of Pauli
  settings, relating overlapping tomography to the problem of covering arrays in combinatorics.
  This significantly reduces the number of measurement settings, showing for instance
  that two-body overlapping tomography of nearest neighbors in qubit systems with
  planar topologies can always be performed with nine Pauli settings. Second, we prove
  that using general projective measurements, all ùëò-body marginals can be reconstructed
  with only 3ùëò settings, independently of the system size. Finally, we demonstrate
  the practical applicability of our methods in a six-photon experiment. Our results
  will find applications in learning noise and interaction patterns in quantum computers
  as well as characterizing fermionic systems in quantum chemistry.
