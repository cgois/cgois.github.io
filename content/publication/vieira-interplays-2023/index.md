abstract: Prepare-and-measure scenarios (pm), in their many forms, can be seen as
  the basic building blocks of communication tasks. As such, they can be used to analyze
  a diversity of classical and quantum protocols—of which dense coding and random
  access codes are key examples—in a unified manner. In particular, the use of entanglement
  as a resource in pm scenarios have only recently started to be systematically investigated,
  and many crucial questions remain open. In this work, we explore such scenarios
  and provide answers to some seminal questions. More specifically, we show that,
  in scenarios where entanglement is a free resource, quantum messages are equivalent
  to classical ones with twice the capacity. We also prove that, in such scenarios,
  it is always advantageous for the parties to share entangled states of dimension
  greater than the transmitted message. Finally, we show that unsteerable states cannot
  provide advantages in classical communication tasks, thus proving that not all entangled
  states are useful resources in these scenarios.
