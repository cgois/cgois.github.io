abstract: Quantum measurements are inherently probabilistic and quantum theory often
  forbids precisely predicting the outcomes of simultaneous measurements. This phenomenon
  is captured and quantified through uncertainty relations. Although studied since
  the inception of quantum theory, the problem of determining the possible expectation
  values of a collection of quantum measurements remains, in general, unsolved. By
  constructing a close connection between observables and graph theory, we derive
  uncertainty relations valid for any set of dichotomic observables. For arbitrary
  observables, we obtain an upper bound on the sum of the square of their expectation
  values. We furthermore show how this bound behaves when the observables are imprecisely
  calibrated. As applications, our results can be straightforwardly used to formulate
  entropic uncertainty relations, separability criteria, and entanglement witnesses.
