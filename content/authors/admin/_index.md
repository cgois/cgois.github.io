<!-- **About me** -->

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Inria, working in the [PhIQus group](https://team.inria.fr/phiqus/) with Marc-Olivier Renou. I completed my Ph.D. in the [TQO group](https://www.physik.uni-siegen.de/tqo/) at Universit채t Siegen under the supervision of Otfried G체hne, and my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Physics at Universidade de Campinas, where I was part of the [MathFoundQ](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/) group with Rafael Rabelo.

My research focuses on the interface between quantum information theory and optimisation. I am interested in various aspects of quantum correlations (entanglement, steering, nonlocality, prepare-and-measure), statistical analysis of quantum state tomography, and in optimisation methods with applications to quantum information (semidefinite programming, noncommutative polynomial optimization). Part of my work involves numerical methods, including contributions to the [Ket.jl](https://github.com/dev-ket/Ket.jl) library.

Outside of research, I like computers, literature, linguistics, popular music, bouldering, hiking and cycling.
