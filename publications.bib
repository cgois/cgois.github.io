	abstract = {Superdense coding is a paradigmatic protocol in quantum information science, employing a quantum communication channel to send classical information more efficiently. As we show here, it can be understood as a particular case of a prepare and measure experiment, a scenario that has attracted growing attention for its fundamental and practical applications. Formulating superdense coding as a prepare and measure scenario allows us to provide a semi-device-independent witness of entanglement that significantly improves over previous tests. Furthermore, we also show how to adapt our results into self-testing of maximally entangled states and also provide a semidefinite program formulation allowing one to efficiently optimize, for any shared quantum state, the probability of success in the superdense coding protocol.},

	abstract = {A central aspect of quantum information is that correlations between spacelike separated observers sharing entangled states cannot be reproduced by local hidden variable (LHV) models, a phenomenon known as Bell nonlocality. If one wishes to explain such correlations by classical means, a natural possibility is to allow communication between the parties. In particular, LHV models augmented with two bits of classical communication can explain the correlations of any two-qubit state. Would this still hold if communication is restricted to measurement outcomes? While in certain scenarios with a finite number of inputs the answer is yes, we prove that if a model must reproduce all projective measurements, then for any qubit-qudit state the answer is no. In fact, a qubit-qudit under projective measurements admits an LHV model with outcome communication if and only if it already admits an LHV model without communication. On the other hand, we also show that when restricted sets of measurements are considered (for instance, when the qubit measurements are in the upper hemisphere of the Bloch ball), outcome communication does offer an advantage. This exemplifies that trivial properties in standard LHV scenarios, such as deterministic measurements and outcome-relabelling, play a crucial role in the outcome communication scenario.},

	abstract = {Characterizing large-scale quantum systems is central to fundamental physics and essential for applications of quantum technologies. While a full characterization requires exponentially increasing resources, focusing on application-relevant information can often lead to significantly simplified analysis. Overlapping tomography is such a scheme, allowing one to obtain all the information contained in specific subsystems of multiparticle quantum systems in an efficient manner, but the ultimate limits of this approach remain elusive. We present protocols for overlapping tomography that are optimal with respect to the number of measurement settings. First, by providing algorithmic approaches based on graph theory we find the minimal number of Pauli settings, relating overlapping tomography to the problem of covering arrays in combinatorics. This significantly reduces the number of measurement settings, showing for instance that two-body overlapping tomography of nearest neighbors in qubit systems with planar topologies can always be performed with nine Pauli settings. Second, we prove that using general projective measurements, all ùëò-body marginals can be reconstructed with only 3ùëò settings, independently of the system size. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in a six-photon experiment. Our results will find applications in learning noise and interaction patterns in quantum computers as well as characterizing fermionic systems in quantum chemistry.},

In particular, the use of entanglement as a resource in pm scenarios have only recently started to be systematically investigated, and many crucial questions remain open. In this work, we explore such scenarios and provide answers to some seminal questions. More specifically, we show that, in scenarios where entanglement is a free resource, quantum messages are equivalent to classical ones with twice the capacity. We also prove that, in such scenarios, it is always advantageous for the parties to share entangled states of dimension greater than the transmitted message. Finally, we show that unsteerable states cannot provide advantages in classical communication tasks, thus proving that not all entangled states are useful resources in these scenarios.},

	abstract = {Quantum state tomography is the standard technique for reconstructing a quantum state from experimental data. In the regime of finite statistics, experimental data cannot give perfect information about the quantum state. A common way to express this limited knowledge is by providing confidence regions in the state space. Though other confidence regions were previously proposed, they are either too wasteful to be of practical interest, cannot easily be applied to general measurement schemes, or are too difficult to report. Here we construct confidence regions that solve these issues, as they have an asymptotically optimal sample cost and good performance for realistic parameters, are applicable to any measurement scheme, and can be described by an ellipsoid in the space of Hermitian operators. Our construction relies on a vector Bernstein inequality and bounds with high probability the Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt norm error of sums of multinomial samples transformed by linear maps.},

	abstract = {Preparing and measuring physical systems are the operational building blocks of any physical experiment, and to describe them is the first purpose of any physical theory. Remarkably, even when only uncharacterized preparation and measurement devices are present, it is sometimes possible to distinguish between the behaviors of quantum and classical systems from only observational data. Certifying the physical origin of measurement statistics in the prepare and measure scenario is of primal importance for developing quantum networks, distributing quantum keys, and certifying randomness, to mention a few applications, but, surprisingly, no general methods to do so are known. We progress on this problem by crafting a general, sufficient condition to certify that a given set of preparations can only generate classical statistics, for any number of generalized measurements. As an application, we employ the method to demonstrate nonclassicality activation in the prepare and measure scenario, also considering its application in random access codes. Following that, we adapt our method to certify, again through a sufficient condition, whether a given set of measurements can never give rise to nonclassical behaviors, irrespective of what preparations they may act upon. This, in turn, allows us to find a large set of incompatible measurements that cannot be used to demonstrate nonclassicality, thus showing incompatibility is not sufficient for nonclassicality in the prepare and measure scenario.},

As such, it is an important component in quantum informational protocols that make use of high-dimensional entanglement. Although it has been recently observed experimentally, the phenomenon of high-dimensional steering is lacking a general certification procedure. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions to certify the entanglement dimension in a steering scenario. These conditions are stated in terms of a hierarchy of semidefinite programs, which can also be used to quantify the phenomenon using the steering dimension robustness. To demonstrate the practical viability of our method, we characterize the dimensionality of entanglement in steering scenarios prepared with maximally entangled states measured in mutually unbiased bases. Our methods give significantly stronger bounds on the noise robustness necessary to experimentally certify high-dimensional entanglement.},

This phenomenon is captured and quantified through uncertainty relations. Although studied since the inception of quantum theory, the problem of determining the possible expectation values of a collection of quantum measurements remains, in general, unsolved. By constructing a close connection between observables and graph theory, we derive uncertainty relations valid for any set of dichotomic observables. For arbitrary observables, we obtain an upper bound on the sum of the square of their expectation values. We furthermore show how this bound behaves when the observables are imprecisely calibrated. As applications, our results can be straightforwardly used to formulate entropic uncertainty relations, separability criteria, and entanglement witnesses.},

	url = {https://dspace.ub.uni-siegen.de/handle/ubsi/6956},
	abstract = {Quantum systems offer significant advantages in information processing and communication, but leveraging these benefits requires reliable methods for extracting relevant information. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the no-cloning theorem, and the existence of incompatible observables, measuring quantum states is an inherently indirect and often costly process. As engineered quantum systems scale beyond the laboratory, the ability to efficiently certify quantum states and their properties becomes indispensable. This thesis examines quantum state certification from three perspectives: correlations, communication, and tomography. Correlations play a key role in security protocols, while communication scenarios highlight potential applications of quantum systems in information transmission. Beyond practical applications, they can also reveal fundamental capabilities and limitations of quantum information. Tomography, on the other hand, provides techniques for reconstructing unknown quantum states and is essential not only for validating quantum devices, but also for extracting results from simulations and computations. Our main contributions include: ‚Ä¢ Establishing a connection between sum-of-squares uncertainty relations and graph-theoretic quantities. ‚Ä¢ Constructing a complete set of criteria for certifying entanglement dimension with an untrusted adversary. ‚Ä¢ Proving an equivalence between classical and quantum communication with entangled parties. ‚Ä¢ Identifying a class of communication games for which having an entanglement dimension larger than the communication dimension can be useful. ‚Ä¢ Providing rigorous statistical guarantees for quantum state tomography experiments applicable to any experimental setup. ‚Ä¢ Connecting the optimal measurement choices for partial state tomography to graph covering problems. ‚Ä¢ Proposing a protocol for characterizing one- and two-body observables in native fermionic simulators.},
